      Welcome to my Webpage! I am a second year graduate student in the department of statistics at Iowa State University. I plan to complete my masters degree in June 2022. I am from Upstate New York, which is where I attended   St. Lawrence University and completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics in 2020.
